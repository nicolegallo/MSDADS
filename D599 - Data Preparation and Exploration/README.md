# Data Preparation and Exploration

## Course Overview

The Data Preparation and Exploration course focused on the early steps of the data analytics life cycle. I learned to clean data to ensure its accuracy and quality, interpreted descriptive and inferential statistics, and used visualizations for data exploration and wrangling. Hypothesis testing was introduced, with an emphasis on parametric tests and effective communication of findings.

## Key Learnings

- Interpreted data dictionaries for understanding data sets.
- Analyzed and applied probability, descriptive and inferential statistics, and visualizations.
- Ensured data accuracy and integrity through effective wrangling techniques.
