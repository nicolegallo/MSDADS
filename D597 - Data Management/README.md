# Data Management

## Course Overview

In the Data Management course, I developed skills in both relational and non-relational databases. I learned about data storage architectures, data types, structures, normalization, and querying databases with SQL. The course also contrasted relational and non-relational approaches to data management.

## Key Learnings

- **Data Storage Architecture**: Selected suitable data storage solutions.
- **Data Types and Structures**: Worked with various data types and structures.
- **Normalization and Denormalization**: Applied techniques for efficient data organization.
- **Querying Databases**: Utilized SQL for DDL, DML, joins, aggregations, and transactions.
- **Relational vs Non-Relational Databases**: Compared and applied both approaches.

## Achievements

By the end of the course, I was able to:

1. **Plan and Discuss**: Created a personalized course plan with my instructor.
2. **Recommend Architecture**: Suggested appropriate data architectures.
3. **Analyze Data**: Evaluated data for its dimensions, quality, and relationships.
4. **Develop Models**: Built logical and physical data models.
5. **Query Databases**: Executed queries to address business questions.
6. **Manipulate Data**: Used data manipulation techniques effectively.
