# Optimization

## Course Overview

In the Optimization course, I addressed business problems requiring iterative maximization or minimization of variables. I explored various optimization approaches, including continuous, discrete, linear, and nonlinear problems, and solved them programmatically using Python and R.

## Key Learnings

- Analyzed business cases to select suitable optimization approaches.
- Identified objective functions and constraints, and solved optimization problems programmatically.
