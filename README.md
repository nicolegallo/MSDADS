## Introduction

I entered the Master of Science in Data Analytics (MSDA) program at Western Governors University (WGU) in May 2025, with an undegraduate degree from Purdue University in Economics. My prior experience consists of 7 years in SEO e-commerce with minimal knowledge in data analysis. My goal is to graduate by end of October 2025.

Throughout this program, I have built a strong foundation in data analysis, learning to use tools and techniques such as Python, SQL, data visualization, and machine learning. This repository showcases the projects I have completed during my journey, reflecting my growth and the skills I have acquired.

## Technologies Used

- Python: For data manipulation, analysis, and machine learning.
- SQL: For database management, querying, and data extraction.
- Pandas & NumPy: For data cleaning, transformation, and analysis.
- Matplotlib & Seaborn: For data visualization.
- scikit-learn: For implementing machine learning models.
- PostgreSQL: For relational database management.
- Jupyter Notebook: For documenting and sharing analysis.
- MongoDB: For NoSQL database management and handling unstructured data.
- pgAdmin: For managing PostgreSQL databases with a graphical interface.
