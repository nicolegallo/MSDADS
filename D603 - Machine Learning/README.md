# Machine Learning

## Course Overview

The Machine Learning course explored algorithms and models for predicting, classifying, and clustering data. I built, trained, and tested both supervised and unsupervised models, including k-nearest neighbors, logistic regression, and clustering techniques, as well as ensemble methods.

## Key Learnings

- Recommended supervised and unsupervised machine learning models based on performance evaluations.
- Applied time series models for forecasting and analyzing temporal data patterns.
