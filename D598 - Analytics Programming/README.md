# Analytics Programming

## Course Overview

In the Analytics Programming course, I honed my algorithmic thinking using Python and R. Building on foundational programming knowledge, I utilized libraries and packages to handle tasks such as data acquisition, organization, and manipulation. I also explored methods for applying statistical functions and creating graphical user interfaces for analysis and presentation.

## Key Learnings

- Documented complex programming tasks into manageable components.
- Integrated programming syntax, control elements, and modular components from Python and R.
- Performed data acquisition and organization using analytics programming languages.
