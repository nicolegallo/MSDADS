# Statistical Data Mining

## Course Overview

In the Statistical Data Mining course, I gained knowledge in data preparation and machine learning techniques. I learned about statistics, regression, and dimensional reduction, and implemented supervised models for classification and prediction. The course also covered unsupervised models and their application to organizational needs.

## Key Learnings

- Executed linear and logistic regressions to derive actionable recommendations.
- Applied principal component analysis (PCA) for dimensional reduction and insight generation.
